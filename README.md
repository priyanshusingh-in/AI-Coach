- Connect to workout/nutrition apps and APIs
- Enable calendar, sleep, and wellness tracking integrations

### Phase 7: Testing & Quality Assurance

- Create comprehensive test suites for backend and mobile
- Test AI response quality, vector search accuracy, and performance
- Ensure privacy, security, and data protection

### Phase 8: Performance Optimization

- Optimize backend and mobile app performance
- Implement caching, compression, and efficient state management
- Enhance AI pipeline efficiency and cost-effectiveness

### Phase 9: Security & Privacy

- Enforce data encryption, input validation, and API security
- Provide user privacy controls, consent management, and data deletion

### Phase 10: Deployment & DevOps

- Set up Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and production infrastructure
- Prepare mobile app for app store distribution and monitoring

This phased approach ensures the project is built with scalability, security, and user experience in mind, delivering a robust AI-powered health and fitness coaching platform.
